## Recipe Sharing Web Application - SimpleSweets [2024] 
- developed by Harvey Pedrosa (BSIT-Sophomore: #learning_Web_Development)

SimpleSweets is a recipe-sharing web application specifically for desserts or sweet foods that provides users or visitors with a comprehensive platform for discovering, sharing, and exploring sweet creations from all around the world, regardless of any cultural diversities published by passionate bakers authorized by admin/s within the app.

This web application uses technological resources (languages, framework, admin_template, and more), such as in the front-end:
# HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap (Framework), & Admin_LTE (Template)
while in the back-end:
# PHP, MySQL, & XAMPP (Mini Web Server Platform)
all of which to develop the web application to serve its main objectives and purpose of promoting the love for creating sweets from scratch. Not to mention, this serves as my 2nd year final requirement for my course IT 263: Integrative Programming and Technologies 1. Other than that, this project is a personal project developed for my enthusiasm for baking cakes and other desserts.
