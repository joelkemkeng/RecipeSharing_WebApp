(63, 1103, 'Use room temperature eggs and butter. Room temperature eggs give you a fluffier cake, and room temperature butter creams better for a feather-light buttercream frosting.'),
(64, 1103, 'One of the top complaints when it comes to baking cakes is that the cake turns out ‚Äúfloury‚Äù, and this is due to using too much flour. The best way to get the right amount of flour is to measure it using a kitchen scale. Alternatively, you can spoon flour into a cup and then scrape a knife across to level it out. Scooping directly from the flour bag or container will inevitably lead to using too much of it.'),
(65, 1103, 'For a cake that has even more moisture, substitute ‚Öì cup of the whole milk for sour cream. This will give you a cake that will stay moist for longer, which is helpful if you plan to make it ahead or keep it for a few days after baking. Note that the batter will be a bit thicker than if you only used milk.'),
(66, 1103, 'To take the chocolatey-ness to the next level, use hot brewed coffee instead of water. Or add 1 tablespoon espresso powder to the wet ingredients. '),

(81, 1104, 'Use a good quality cocoa powder so your brownie batter is extra delicious!'),
(82, 1104, 'Make sure to let the brookies cool completely before removing them from the pan and slicing, they\'ll be too soft when warm.'),
(83, 1104, 'You can add in grated orange zest, mini marshmallows, sprinkles, or different flavored extracts for different variations.'),
(84, 1104, 'Try adding ¬æ cup of toasted, chopped walnuts or pecans to the batter for added crunch and flavor.'),
(85, 1104, 'You can warm the Brookies up slightly in the oven or microwave and serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an extra treat.'),
(102, 1108, 'Perform 4 stretch and folds during the first 2 hours of the bulk fermentation, which build strength in the dough.'),
(103, 1108, 'Do a cold proof for at least 24 hours before baking, which produces a lighter airier crumb as you can see the difference between the crumb of a loaf that has proofed for only 6 hours vs. a loaf that has proofed for 24 hours. '),
(104, 1108, 'Finally, I like preheating my Dutch oven, which makes a crisper crust.'),
(120, 1111, 'For the fluffiest cake, do not skip sifting your dry ingredients. Sifting will aerate them and remove any possible lumps in the dry ingredients.'),
(121, 1111, 'I highly recommend using a scale to measure your flour. However, if you don‚Äôt have a scale, be sure to fluff your flour with a spoon and then spoon it into your cups before leveling it off with a knife. This method is the best way to measure flour without overpacking the measuring cup.'),
(122, 1111, 'Avoid over-mixing as you risk over-developing the gluten in the batter leading to a tough, dry, and dense cake.'),
(123, 1111, 'Eggs are easier to separate when cold. Egg whites whip up easier when closer to room temperature. I recommend separating them in advance if you have the time.'),
(124, 1111, 'When folding in the egg whites, turn the mixture in on itself with a cutting motion, not stirring. This way, you do not deflate the egg whites.'),
(125, 1111, 'When whipping the egg whites, make sure there‚Äôs no water or liquid in the mixer as it‚Äôll prevent the egg whites from forming peaks.'),
(157, 1119, 'Sprinkle flour over the flat surface to prevent the dough from sticking or use a silicon mat. Arrange the first dough over the cake pan. This will be the base. Set the second flattened dough aside. This will be needed after arranging the filling in the cake pan.'),

(164, 1121, 'Add cream of tartar when you see some egg foam. Gradually add fine sugar when the beaten egg whites have become very white and foamy. '),
(165, 1121, 'You can add flavorings to this cheesecake such as 2 tablespoons of matcha powder or 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder to the egg yolk batter, to make either a green-tea flavored Japanese cheesecake or a chocolate Japanese cheesecake.'),
(169, 1120, 'When prepping both the canned coconut milk and evaporated milk, give their cans a good shake before opening! This is important since you‚Äôll be dividing the milks in half to use in different parts of the recipe.'),
(170, 1120, 'The original recipe calls for a 9 x 11-inch pan, which isn‚Äôt a very common pan size in the United States. As a result, I‚Äôve adapted the recipe to be made in a 9- or 10-inch springform pan.'),
(171, 1110, 'Weigh the flour in which the most accurate way to measure flour is with a kitchen scale. If you don‚Äôt have one, fluff up the flour in its container and spoon it into the measuring cup, using a knife to level off the top.'),
(172, 1110, 'Use room temperature ingredients to ensure they incorporate easily with the other ingredients'),
(173, 1110, 'Shred carrots at home using a box grater or your food processor.'),
(174, 1110, 'Swap pecans for chopped walnuts. Or, reduce the nuts to ¬Ω cup and add ¬Ω cup dark or golden raisins along with ¬º cup sweetened shredded coconut.'),
(175, 1110, 'You can replace ‚Öì cup of vegetable oil with an equal amount of applesauce or canned crushed pineapple (drained well).'),
(176, 1114, 'Always use fresh lemon juice is a must. Lemons are the star ingredient so you don\'t want to go the from concentrate or a bottle versions.'),
(177, 1114, 'Line your baking dish. The parchment paper makes it very easy to remove from the pan but in a pinch you can use foil instead.'),
(178, 1114, 'Lemon bars are a great make ahead dessert. Cut then freeze on a baking try. Wrap individually and store in your freezer for up to three months. That and dust with powdered sugar before serving. '),
(179, 1115, 'If you only have unsalted butter, use that and include ¬º tsp salt in the recipe - add it with the flour.'),
(180, 1115, 'If you are having a hard time working with all of the dough in the piping bag at once, you can take a little out and add as needed - this will make it a little easier to pipe. '),
(188, 1117, 'Sift cocoa powder into flour mixture if it\'s clumpy.'),
(189, 1117, 'Avoid making the oven too hot when pre-heating.'),
(194, 1118, 'Baked cookies freeze well up to 3 months. Unbaked cookie dough balls (that are not coated in confectioners‚Äô sugar) freeze well up to 3 months.'),
(195, 1118, 'The recipe is easy to double in 1 mixing bowl without overwhelming your mixer. Simply double all of the ingredients. Dough chill time remains the same.'),
(196, 1118, 'If you want a chocolate peppermint crinkle cookie, I recommend adding 3/4 or 1 teaspoon of peppermint extract when you add the vanilla.'),
(197, 1123, 'Alyways measure your flour correctly! Adding too much flour to the recipe is the most common mistake. The best, and easiest way to measure flour is by using a scale. If you don\'t have one then fluff your flour with a spoon, sprinkle it into your measuring cup, and use a knife to level it off.'),
(198, 1123, 'Sift the dry ingredients, cocoa powder can have a lot of lumps.'),
(199, 1123, 'Room temperature ingredients will mix best so make sure the butter, eggs, sour cream, and milk are not ice cold.'),
(200, 1123, 'Have fun with the decorations! Use your favorite candies, piping tips, and accessories to make these ornaments come to life. '),
(201, 1124, 'Room temperature butter and egg will mix more evenly into each other. Place your egg into a bowl of warm water for a couple of minutes. Doing so will quickly bring it to room temperature if you have forgotten to take it out of your fridge beforehand.'),
(202, 1124, 'Use pure vanilla extract and not artificial extract for these candy cane peppermint cookies for the best flavor.'),
(203, 1124, 'Adding too much flour will lead to the candy cane shaped cookies being dense. The best and easiest way to measure the flour is by using a kitchen scale. If you don‚Äôt have one, then fluff your flour with a spoon, sprinkle it into your measuring cup, and use a knife to level it.'),
(204, 1124, 'Twist together one cookie at a time instead of rolling all the white and red dough out first. The cookie dough will be dry by the time the doughs are all rolled and ready to be twisted.'),
(205, 1124, 'If the cookie dough starts to crack as you roll it, put it back in the fridge to chill for 15 minutes so the dough firms up more.'),
(212, 1125, 'If needed, you can use salted butter in this recipe with no other changes needed. I‚Äôve also successfully reduced the butter down to 6 Tablespoons (85g) with no issue (just as tasty).'),
(213, 1125, 'Feel free to add 1 cup of your favorite chocolate chips. No need to leave out the nuts if you add the chocolate chips. Chocolate chips and nuts are both optional.'),
(214, 1125, 'This is not an overly sweet quick bread. If you want a sweeter banana bread, increase to 1 cup (200g) brown sugar.'),
(219, 1126, 'This dessert can be stored in the fridge for up to one and half days (36 hours) ahead of time, before serving - for best results.'),
(220, 1126, 'Full disclosure: this is not a cake that involves getting into an oven.'),
(221, 1127, 'The mango float can be stored in the container for up to one month. When you want to eat it, let it defrost for about 10 minutes, and then you can use a knife to cut out a piece. I usually let my piece sit out for 10-15 minutes to soften before eating it.'),
(233, 1122, 'Choose a mixture of tart apples and sweet apples.'),
(234, 1122, 'Properly peel the apples in consistent manner.'),
(235, 1122, 'A sprinkle of white sugar will give this apple pie recipe a slightly crunchy topping, adding some textural interest and a little extra sweetness.'),
(236, 1122, 'Prevent the crust from browning too much, always check the oven temperature especially in the middle of baking.'),
(312, 1131, 'There are a couple ways to make this pie ahead of time. Prepare the pie in full 1 day in advance‚Äîafter pie cools, cover tightly and keep at room temperature. The pie crust dough can also be prepared ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Baked pie also freezes well for up to 3 months.'),
(313, 1131, 'You need about 1.5 lbs of cherries for this recipe. Cut half of the cherries into halves and the remaining half of cherries into quarters. Using a mix of halved and quartered cherries helps keep the baked filling in tact. You can use any variety of cherries.'),
(314, 1132, 'To assure the best tasting fruitcake, make sure all of your ingredients are of good quality and as fresh as possible.'),
(315, 1132, 'Because this cake is so dense, it will take longer to cool than other types of cake.'),
(316, 1132, 'To make the fruitcake a little more festive, serve it with a brandy sauce or this classic English custard sauce.'),
(317, 1132, 'Add 1 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans to the fruitcake for extra texture and flavor.'),
(330, 1129, 'Any kind of cream cheese can be used for this recipe including mascarpone.'),
(331, 1129, 'I tested this recipe with 2 cups of sugar, and it was very good. However, I felt it was too sweet, so I reduced the sugar in my final recipe. If you prefer a very sweet cheesecake, feel free to add more sugar.'),

(333, 1106, 'Cupcakes can be made ahead 1 day in advance, covered, and stored at room temperature. Frosting can also be made 1 day in advance, covered, and stored in the refrigerator until ready to use. Freeze frosted or unfrosted cupcakes for up to 2-3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator.'),
(334, 1106, 'If you can‚Äôt get your hands on cake flour, you can make a cake flour substitute. I suggest doing this twice, mixing it all up in 1 bowl then removing 1/4 cup since you need 1 and 3/4 cups in this recipe.'),
(335, 1106, 'Using all egg whites is the key to their soft and fluffy texture.'),
(336, 1106, 'Whole milk and sour cream are strongly recommended for the best taste and texture. A full fat plain yogurt would work instead, though the cupcakes may not be as light. Same goes with a lower fat milk.'),
(337, 1133, 'Turn this banana bread into muffins by lining a cupcake tip with liners. Bake for 25-30 minutes at the same temperature, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.'),
(338, 1133, 'Keep your banana bread wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, foil or Tupperware at room temperature for 2-3 days or up to a week in the refrigerator.'),
(341, 1105, 'For the ultimate velvety crumb, look for cake flour with lower protein content. I use King Arthur‚Äôs unbleached cake flour, as it‚Äôs always available at my local Target mall.'),
(342, 1105, 'Feel free to sub your homemade ube halaya, and keep an eye on the texture.'),
(343, 1105, 'There are many brands of sweetened condensed milk with different flavors and colors. Look at this article from Serious Eats here if you want to learn about the differences. In my recipe here, I‚Äôve used the Eagle Brand.'),
(344, 1105, 'You don‚Äôt want the butter to be super soft, but give a little when you push it like a ripe avocado. This ensures you‚Äôll be able to whip it up to the right texture and pull in the condensed milk to make the frosting.'),
(345, 1134, 'If you only have one cake pan, I would only make (or even mix together) half of the batter at a time to prevent your batter from collapsing while you wait for one cake to finish baking and cooling. Yes, this is a pain to divide the ingredients, but since we are using meringue and egg whites, you want to keep the airy and lofty texture of the cake as much as possible. Waiting too long to use the batter might give you less than fluffy results.'),
(346, 1134, 'I included ingredients by weight because this is more accurate for baking.'),
(347, 1130, 'Cover the cake with chocolate drizzle icing by mixing 30g/1oz cocoa powder with 200g/7oz of icing sugar and \r\na teaspoon or two of boiling water. Mix to a paste the consistency of double cream. Trickle over the cake and allow to \r\nset before slicing.'),
(348, 1130, 'Pan size- small rectangle (loaf pan) (3x the batter ingredients for 10x12 cake pans).'),
(349, 1130, 'Always check the oven temparature to avoid the cake from overbaking. It is a must for great results.'),
(350, 1135, 'Depending on the size of the roll or sheet of parchment paper you buy, you may have to overlap it.'),
(351, 1135, 'You can use 5 large eggs if you don&#039;t have jumbo eggs, and 3/4 to 1 teaspoon of kosher salt instead of the 1/2 teaspoon of fine salt.'),
(352, 1136, 'You may also use instant yeast which requires no proofing and can be added directly to the flour before kneading. Using instant yeast will also cut the rising time. Add the ¬º cup of water for proofing ADY to the liquids instead.'),
(353, 1136, 'For puffier and faster rising, I recommend using SAF Instant Gold which is made for sweet dough.'),
(354, 1137, 'This recipe makes about 48 macaron shells, which can be used to make 24 macarons. You can double or half this recipe if needed.'),
(355, 1137, 'The yield and bake time can vary based on how large you pipe your shells. I piped these shells with a diameter of 1 1/2 inches, so they&#039;re about the size of a standard macaron.'),
(356, 1137, 'Measure your ingredients in grams with a kitchen scale! You really need to be precise with this recipe. Your macarons will turn out best if the ingredients are weighed.'),
(357, 1137, 'Carefully read through the directions before making these macarons. There are quite a few steps and it&#039;s good to know your game plan before you start!'),
(358, 1137, 'You can make the pistachio ganache ahead of time if needed! It can last for up to a week in the fridge if it&#039;s wrapped tightly with plastic wrap or stored in an airtight container.'),
(359, 1116, 'If the tops of your cake layers are domed, use a serrated knife to cut off the top of the domes so you can stack them evenly. Alternatively, use cake strips to help your cake layers come out evenly. Cake strips work by keeping the outside edge of the pan cooler to ensure that the entire cake rises at the same rate, preventing a dome from forming in the middle.'),
(360, 1116, 'I highly recommend using a scale to measure your flour as it‚Äôs the most accurate method. If you don‚Äôt have a scale, fluff your flour with a spoon and spoon it into your cups before leveling it off with a knife. This method prevents you from overpacking the measuring cup.'),
(361, 1116, 'If the ingredients were refrigerated, such as the eggs, milk, and cream cheese, it‚Äôs best to bring them to room temperature before using them so they mix effortlessly without overmixing.'),
(362, 1116, 'Be gentle when handling the layers during assembly, as the cake is very tender.'),
(363, 1116, 'The best way to let your butter come to room temperature is to bring it out of the fridge 1 to 2 hours beforehand and allow it to sit on your kitchen counter. Softening the butter in the microwave will carry the risk of it melting and making the cream cheese frosting runny. To speed up the process of the butter coming to room temperature, you can cube it instead of leaving the sticks whole.'),
(364, 1116, 'Make sure to sift the dry ingredients to remove any lumps. This will help to keep the cake‚Äôs crumb soft and light.'),
(365, 1116, 'For a large cake, divide the batter among two 9-inch round cake pans. The layers will be a bit thinner, so the bake time will decrease by about 5 minutes.');

Recently, I have been stopping the bulk fermentation when the dough increases by 50% in volume, and I feel I am actually getting better oven spring in the end.)

If you live in a warm, humid environment, the bulk fermentation may take even less time. In the late spring/early summer, for example, my kitchen is 78¬∫F and the bulk fermentation takes 6 hours. It is best to rely on visual cues (increase in volume by roughly 50%) as opposed to time to determine when the bulk fermentation is done.
